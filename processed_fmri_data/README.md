The results in this folder were calculated and processed using
rtSimFlickerAnalysis.m and optimalFlickerAnalysis.m

Those scripts will pre-process and plot the raw (rtSim) and processed (optimal)
fMRI data from subject TOME_3021, collected with a sequence of flickering
checkerboard stimuli, with frequency varying randomly.

The results are saved and shared here for easy re-analysis using
validate_qpWatsonTFE_realFMRI.m in the neurofeedback Git repo.
